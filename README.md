# **Assignment 1**
### *Alter and Display an Image in Real Time*
Objective: Implement numerous key components and libraries to properly demonstrate comprehension of the introductory concepts. The assignment is intended to demonstrate the implementation of knowledge on topics such as working with images, image adjustments, active previewing, and saving functionality.

# **Assignment 2**
### *Implementation of Filters Upon Imagery*
Objective: Apply knowledge of the mathematical and logical components of image filtration via code. Numerous image filters were expanded upon through the educational setting in a presentation detailing the mathematical premise behind image filtering and the physical changes caused by these functions. The Box Filter or Mean Filter, the Sobel Filter, and the Gaussian Blur Filter were centered constructs.

# **Assignment 3**
### *Segmentation Methods for Imagery*
Objective: Apply knowledge of the mathematical and logical theory regarding image segmentation via code. Four images were fed into the program for a designated segmentation process. The two processes for implementation involve Otsu Binarization and Mean Shift segmentation methods. The combination of manual programming and pre-existing libraries allows for optimal results and demonstration of comprehension.
